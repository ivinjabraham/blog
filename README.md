# Blog

I can't think of anything creative to name this project nor do I think it really needs a specific name.

This is the source for [my self-hosted blog](http://blog.ivinjoelabraham.com). It uses [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) with the [Serene theme](https://github.com/isunjn/serene/) by `isunjn`.

All posts are my own.
