Been a while since I posted. TBH I'm not sure how to write posts that would be worth reading. I have two half-written posts about drivers and assembly. I've taken down two existing ones that I feel like aren't up to my mark. I've started using obsidian recently and it's been treating me pretty well so far. But why do people believe it doesn't share your data? I don't worry about it, but that's what people seem to believe.

In other news, GSoC results will be out tomorrow. Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to work on much in the last month or so due to personal circumstances. I just recently got out of the slump and was exploring the AppImage spec today. Even sent a little PR correcting the documentation of the spec.
